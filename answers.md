## Activity 2

### Responses to chats:
- "Tell me more about your family."
- "Why so negative?"
- "You don't say."
- "Why so negative?"

### Keywords and responses:
1. friend - "Tell me more about your friends."
2. school - "How is your school?"
3. work - "Do you have a job?"
- It prioritizes the first keyword if there are more than 1.

### Question answers:
1. It still reads keywords if they're in other words, so the problem is that they still get read.
